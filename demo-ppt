Slide 2 - About ITAF Framework


‚Ä¢ Modular, scalable, reusable automation framework
‚Ä¢ Built using Java, Selenium, Cucumber, Spring Boot & Rest-Assured
‚Ä¢ Supports both UI and API automation
‚Ä¢ Focused on reducing maintenance and accelerating automation delivery

Slide 3 - Current Challenges


‚Ä¢ Manual script creation is time-consuming
‚Ä¢ Repeated boilerplate code across test scenarios
‚Ä¢ Limited reuse of pre-defined ITAF steps
‚Ä¢ Onboarding new testers requires framework understanding

Slide 4 - GitHub Copilot ‚Äì Overview


‚Ä¢ AI-powered code assistant from GitHub
‚Ä¢ Trained on billions of lines of code
‚Ä¢ Understands context and suggests entire functions or files
‚Ä¢ Integrates seamlessly with VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.


Slide  - Copilot + ITAF Integration

‚Ä¢ Copilot guided by ITAF-specific prompts/instructions
‚Ä¢ Automatically generates API test scripts compatible with ITAF standards
‚Ä¢ Uses ITAF utilities like ITAFApiUtil, AuthUtil, and APIScenarioContext
‚Ä¢ Reduces manual errors and increases productivity

Slide - Example Prompt ‚Üí Output (1/2)


**Prompt:**
Generate API test scenario for POST /loan with payload and headers

**Copilot Output:**
Scenario: Verify create loan API
Given api request with base url "https://xyz.com"
And with headers | content-type | application/json |
And with query parameters | groupId | 123 |
And with request payload "payloads/xyz.json"
And update payload with following values | $.loanAmount | 500 |
When user sends "POST" request to "/createLoan"
Then verify response code is 200

Slide - Example Prompt ‚Üí Output (2/2)


**Prompt:**
Extract loanAmount from response, store as oldLoanAmount, and send GET /verifyLoan

**Copilot Output:**
And store response value of jsonPath "$.loanAmount" with key "oldLoanAmount"
When user sends "GET" request to "/verifyLoan" with query parameter loanAmount=${oldLoanAmount}
Then verify response code is 200

Slide- Benefits of Copilot + ITAF


‚Ä¢ Faster automation script development (up to 40‚Äì60%)
‚Ä¢ Consistent code quality aligned with ITAF standards
‚Ä¢ Reuse of existing framework utilities
‚Ä¢ Accelerated onboarding for new automation engineers
‚Ä¢ Reduced dependency on framework experts

Slide - Next Steps

1. Approve GitHub Copilot Enterprise license for automation team
2. Configure Copilot with ITAF-specific custom instructions
3. Pilot phase: auto-generation of API scripts
4. Scale across teams post evaluation
5. Continuous improvement and prompt tuning

3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Talking Points

Current Challenge

Script creation is manual and repetitive.

Each team has its own style ‚Üí inconsistent scripts.

Onboarding new testers takes time due to ITAF learning curve.

Solution

GitHub Copilot trained with ITAF standards acts as a virtual pair programmer.

Copilot understands ITAF step patterns, utilities, and best practices.

Testers describe test requirements in plain English or JSON ‚Äî Copilot converts them into ready-to-run Cucumber scenarios and step definitions.

Vision

ITAF + Copilot = AI-assisted test automation platform.

Empower every tester to generate consistent, production-ready scripts faster.


Live Demo Flow
Step 1: Setup context for Copilot

Explain that Copilot has been given custom ITAF instructions, so it knows:

Standard ITAF step patterns

Utility classes like ITAFApiUtil, AuthUtil, ApiScenarioContext

Expected scenario structure

Show this briefly in the Copilot ‚ÄúCustom Instructions‚Äù panel.



Step 2: Generate scenario from plain text

üó£ Prompt in Copilot:

‚ÄúCreate a Cucumber scenario for POST /request/createLoan with payload updates and validations as per ITAF standards.‚Äù

‚úÖ Copilot Output:
A full ITAF-compliant Gherkin scenario:

Scenario: Verify declined loan request
  Given api request with base url "https://xyz.com"
  And with headers
    |content-type|application/json|
    |channel|application|
  And with request payload "payloads/xyz.json"
  And update payload with following values
    |jsonPath|value|
    |$.loanAmount|500|
    |$.purchaseAmount|400|
  When user sends "POST" request to "/request/createLoan"
  Then verify response code is 200
  And response should contain following json paths and values
    |jsonPath|expectedValue|
    |$.message|declined|
    |$.loanAmount|500|


Explain: ‚ÄúInstead of spending 15‚Äì20 minutes writing this manually, Copilot generates it in seconds ‚Äî fully aligned with ITAF syntax.‚Äù


Step 3: Generate Java step definition

Prompt Copilot to create the missing step:

‚ÄúImplement step definition for ‚ÄòAnd store response value of jsonPath "$.loanAmount" with key "oldLoanAmount"‚Äô‚Äù

‚úÖ Copilot auto-writes:

@And("store response value of jsonPath {string} with key {string}")
public void storeResponseValue(String jsonPath, String key) {
    Object value = JsonPath.read(response.getBody().asString(), jsonPath);
    ApiScenarioContext.set(key, value);
}


Highlight:

Standards followed

Consistent naming conventions

Ready to plug-in and run


Step 4: Generate scenario from JSON or Postman collection

üó£ Prompt:

‚ÄúGenerate Cucumber scenario using the following Postman metadata‚Äù
(Paste ITAF_EXTENSIONS JSON)

‚úÖ Copilot parses it and outputs a full ITAF scenario automatically.

Explain:

Copilot can read structured input (JSON or Postman collection)

Enables CI/CD integration where Postman exports become ready test scripts

Step 5: Run in ITAF

Show the generated scenario running successfully inside your ITAF runner (optional if time allows).

üìà 5Ô∏è‚É£ Key Benefits to Highlight
Area	Before Copilot	With Copilot	Benefit
Script Creation	Manual (20‚Äì30 min per test)	Auto-generated (2‚Äì3 min)	~90% time saved
Consistency	Varies by tester	Standardized ITAF pattern	Zero deviation
Onboarding	2‚Äì3 weeks for new joiners	2‚Äì3 days	Faster ramp-up
Maintenance	Prone to errors	AI-assisted corrections	Reduced rework
Coverage	Limited by manual capacity	Broader, faster coverage	Higher productivity

Talking Points for Management

ROI: Within 2‚Äì3 months, Copilot can save hundreds of tester-hours weekly.

Quality: AI ensures strict adherence to ITAF standards ‚Äî no custom or ad-hoc scripting.

Scalability: Copilot helps even new team members produce enterprise-grade scripts quickly.

Future vision: Extend same approach to UI testing, data-driven tests, and MFE automation.

Demo Close and Ask

‚ÄúWith ITAF and GitHub Copilot together, we‚Äôre not just automating tests ‚Äî we‚Äôre automating the creation of automation itself.
This means faster delivery, consistent quality, and scalable productivity across all teams.
With Copilot licenses, we can immediately accelerate our automation roadmap and demonstrate measurable ROI within the first sprint.‚Äù
